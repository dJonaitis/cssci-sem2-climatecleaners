## Purpose
This is a website built as part of the semester 2 project for the University of Amsterdam's Computational Social Science bachelor's programme. 

The purpose of the website is to inform users about nature-based solutions to climate change and motivate behavioural change. The change being motivated is converting (potential) entrepreneurs into utilising nature-based solutions in their ventures.

It was made in collaboration with the non-profit foundation Climate Cleanup.
